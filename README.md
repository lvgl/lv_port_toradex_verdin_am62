# LVGL ported to Verdin AM62 on Linux BSP

## Overview

This guide provides steps to cross-compile an LVGL project for the Verdin AM62 from Toradex. The project is based on the [lv_drivers](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_drivers/tree/release/v8.3) and [lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/release/v8.3) repositories and a lvgl demo from [dialog lvgl](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/pcoval/dialog-lvgl.git).

This repository offers insstructions on how to cross-compile and run lvgl framwork and application on top of the [Weston](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Weston) compositor.  

## Buy

You can purchase the Verdin AM62 and compatible carrier boards directly from Toradex.'

## Specification

### CPU and Memory
- **Module:** Vedin AM62
- **RAM:** 1GB DDR RAM
- **Flash:** 8GB eMMC Flash
- **GPU:** PowerVR Rogue AXE-1-16M

## Getting started

### Hardware setup
- Insert the Verdin AM62 module into one of Toradexâ€™s carrier boards, e,g. Dahlia with DSI to HDMI adapter.
- Connect a display to the carrier board. HDMI interface from the DSI to HDMI adapter on Dahlia can be enabled by the [device tree overlays](https://developer.toradex.cn/torizon/application-development/use-cases/multimedia/setting-up-displays-with-torizon/#HDMI).
```
root@verdin-am62:~# cat /boot/overlays.txt
fdt_overlays=verdin-am62_dsi-to-hdmi_overlay.dtbo verdin-am62_spidev_overlay.dtbo
```

### Software setup
- Ensure the Verdin AM62 module is running [reference multimedia image](https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-embedded-software/toradex-download-links-torizon-linux-bsp-wince-and-partner-demos/#TdxRef6QuarterlyMult). The default autostart demo can be stoped by `systemctl stop wayland-app-launch.service`. The image comes with a default root user with empty password.
- On the Linux host, install [Linux SDK](https://developer.toradex.com/linux-bsp/os-development/build-yocto/linux-sdks/) for Verdin AM62. For example, the Linux SDK is installed at `~/SDK`. Source the environment script in every shell session.
```
$ . environment-setup-aarch64-tdx-linux 
```

### Build the binary on the host
- Clone this repository repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_toradex_verdin_am62.git
```

- apply patchs
```
cd lvgl
patch -p 1 < ../lvgl.patch

cd lv_drivers
patch -p 1 < ../lv_drivers.patch

cd dialog-lvgl
patch -p 1 < ../dialog.patch
```

lv_drivers.patch contains an absolute path of Linux SDK that needs to be changed to your own.
```
include_directories(~/SDK/sysroots/aarch64-tdx-linux/usr/src/debug/weston/10.0.2-r0/build)
```

- build lvgl and lv_drivers

header files and built libraries are installed to a `lvgl_wayland` folder which will be copied to Linux SDK intallation path later for application compile.
```
cd lvgl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../lvgl_wayland
make
make install


cd lv_driver
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../lvgl_wayland
make
make install
```

- copy files to Linux SDK intallation path
Linux SDK was installed at `~/SDK` and it has to been changed to your own path.
```
cd ../../lvgl_wayland
cp -r ./* ~/SDK/sysroots/aarch64-tdx-linux/usr/
```

- build application

```
cd dialog-lvgl
make lvgl_driver=wayland
```
The binar `dialog-lvgl` will be generated.



### Run the binary on the module

copy `dialog-lvgl` to Verdin AM62, set library path and excute the bianry.
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/plugins/wayland-shell-integration
./dialog-lvgl
```
